# South African ID for Laravel

The validator will pass values generated by the Faker
[idNumber](https://fakerphp.org/locales/en_ZA/#fakerprovideren_zaperson)
formatter that is part of the English (South Africa) or `en_ZA` locale.
Validation rules and an Eloquent Model attribute cast to value object encapsulating a South African government-issued personal identification number, for Laravel.

## Install

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install the package.

```shell
composer require spoorsny/laravel-south-african-id
```

## Usage

### Validation Rules

A value submitted in a request can be validated to be a South African ID.

```php
use Spoorsny\Laravel\Rules\SouthAfricanId;

$request->validate([
    'id_number' => ['required', 'string', new SouthAfricanId()],
]);
```

If the request also contains a birth date field, that field can be validated to
match the South African ID using the `BirthDateMatchSouthAfricanId` rule. In
this case, the field containing the South African ID, must be named
`south_african_id`.

```php
use Spoorsny\Laravel\Rules\BirthDateMatchSouthAfricanId;
use Spoorsny\Laravel\Rules\SouthAfricanId;

$request->validate([
    'south_african_id' => ['required', 'string', new SouthAfricanId()],
    'birth_date' => [
        'date_format:Y-m-d',
        'before_or_equal:today',
        new BirthDateMatchSouthAfricanId()
    ],
]);
```

### Cast

An attribute of an
[Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/eloquent#generating-model-classes)
model can be cast to an instance of the South African ID
value object (`\Spoorsny\ValueObjects\SouthAfricanId` provided by Composer
package
[`spoorsny/south-african-id`](https://packagist.org/spoorsny/south-african-id)).

```php
use Spoorsny\Laravel\Casts\AsSouthAfricanId;

/**
 * Get the attributes that should be cast.
 *
 * @return array<string, string>
 */
protected function casts(): array
{
    return [
        'south_african_id' => AsSouthAfricanId::class,
    ];
}
```
